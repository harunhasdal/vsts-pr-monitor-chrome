This is a chrome extension which would monitor all the repositories in a given Azure DevOps project for active Pull Requests and lists them as links so that the developers can monitor what needs to be reviewed.

## Usage

Note that you'll need to have an active session with Azure DevOps in order to retreive the list of pull requests.

## Development
